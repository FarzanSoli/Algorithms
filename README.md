# Fun_Algorithms
 Here you can find an implementation of some algorithms similar to those asked in interviews.

### "getTotalEfficiency":
In this example, you are given a list of team members' skills. You have to group these members into teams with two. There is a condition where the summation of skills in each team must be equal to others. For instance, for Skills = [4,5,4,1,2,4], we have Team_1 = [1,5] and Team_2 = [2,4]. Then, you are asked to find the sum of teams' efficiency, where efficiency = skill_1*skill_2 for each team.

##### Solution: 
I created a code that solves this problem. In the output, you are asked to provide the length of the skill list (number of members) and then provide each skill one at a time.
